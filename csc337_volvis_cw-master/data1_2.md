Teddy Bear wthout the Wall

{(aim|} The walll behind the teddy bear made it difiult to analyse the object especiall the back side of it so in this presentation the wall was removed and the bear was represented on its own
{|aim)}

{(vistype|} Due to the ehavy load and multiple crashing (The slice function and volume visualisation was impossible to use together) the representation was changed to surface

{(vismapping|} The colour map was used to ma appropiate colours to each data point.
{|vismapping)}

{(dataprep|} Apart from the rescaling aplied in the previous part, a clipping filter was also added. This was a sphere clipping with a center of [238, 175, 22] and a radius of 225 to ensure the bear is extracted without minimal part of the wall attached to it
{|dataprep)}

{(limitations|} This is a very limited visualisation of how the teddy bear look without anything blocking it. unfortunately the limitation regarding the details of the bear was still visible in this visualisation.
